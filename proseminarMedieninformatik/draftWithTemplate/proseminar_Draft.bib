abstract = {P.I.A.N.O. aims to support learning to play piano with a steep learning curve. In order to achieve this, traditional, hard-to-learn music notation is substituted for an alternative representation of a composition, which is projected directly onto the piano. Furthermore, we propose three different learning modes which support the natural learning process, incorporate live feedback and performance evaluation, as well as the augmentation of the system with aspects of gamification to achieve early experiences of success and prolonged motivation.},

abstract = {Learning to play a musical instrument such as the piano requires a substantial amount of practice and perseverance in learning to read and play from sheet music. Our interactivity demo allows people to learn to play songs without requiring sheet music reading skills. We project a graphical notation on top of a piano that indicates what key(s) need to be pressed and create a feedback loop that monitors the player's performance. We implemented The Augmented Piano (TAP), which is a straightforward combination of a physical piano with our alternative notation projected on top. Piano Attack (PAT) extends TAP with a shooting game that continuously provides game-based incentives for learning to play the piano.},

abstract = {Learning to play the piano is a prolonged challenge for novices. It requires them to learn sheet music notation and its mapping to respective piano keys, together with articulation details. Smooth playing further requires correct finger postures. The result is a slow learning progress, often causing frustration and strain. To overcome these issues, we propose P.I.A.N.O., a piano learning system with interactive projection that facilitates a fast learning process. Note information in form of an enhanced piano roll notation is directly projected onto the instrument and allows mapping of notes to piano keys without prior sight-reading skills. Three learning modes support the natural learning process with live feedback and performance evaluation. We report the results of two user studies, which show that P.I.A.N.O. supports faster learning, requires significantly less cognitive load, provides better user experience, and increases perceived musical quality compared to sheet music notation and non-projected piano roll notation.},

abstract = {Expert musicians' performances embed a timing variability pattern that can be used to recognize individual performance. However, it is not clear if such a property of performance variability is a consequence of learning or an intrinsic characteristic of human performance. In addition, little evidence exists about the role of timing and motion in recognizing individual music performance. In this paper we investigate these questions in the context of piano playing. We conducted a study during which we asked non-musicians to perform a musical sequence at different speeds. Then we tested their learning performance at a fixed tempo. Focusing on the possibility to identify the participant based on performance features of timing and motion variability, we show that participant classification increases with practice. This suggests that 1) the individual timing signatures are affected by learning and 2) timing and motion variability is structured. Moreover, we show that motion features better classify individual performances than timing features.},

abstract = {While computers excel at augmenting user's cognitive abilities, only recently we started utilizing their full potential to enhance our physical abilities. More and more wearable force-feedback devices have been developed based on exoskeletons, electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) or pneumatic actuators. The latter, pneumatic-based artificial muscles, are of particular interest since they strike an interesting balance: lighter than exoskeletons and more precise than EMS. However, the promise of using artificial muscles to actually support skill acquisition and training users is still lacking empirical validation.In this paper, we unveil how pneumatic artificial muscles impact skill acquisition, using two-handed drumming as an example use case. To understand this, we conducted a user study comparing participants' drumming performance after training with the audio or with our artificial-muscle setup. Our haptic system is comprised of four pneumatic muscles and is capable of actuating the user's forearm to drum accurately up to 80 bpm. We show that pneumatic muscles improve participants' correct recall of drumming patterns significantly when compared to auditory training.},

abstract = {Passive haptic learning (PHL) is a phenomenon where one is able to acquire new motor skills through repeated haptic stimuli applied to the body without paying active attention to learning. In the following work, we investigated the retention of passively learned material compared to actively learned material. For the purposes of answering this question, we invited 20 individuals to learn a 10-note sequence actively and a 10-note sequence passively on a piano. The subjects were then tested 3 days later on their remembered material. There was no significant difference between passive and active learning when the subjects played the note sequences from memory. After being cued (auditory and visually) the participants were able to recall the passively learned note sequence significantly better.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the design of adaptive tools for motor skill training that use shape change to automatically vary task difficulty based on a learner’s performance. Studies [1] have shown that automatically-adaptive tools lead to significantly higher learning gains when compared to non-adaptive and manually-adaptive tools. We demonstrate the use of Adapt2Learn [2] - a toolkit that supports designers in building adaptive training tools. Adapt2Learn auto-generates an algorithm that converts a learner’s performance data into adaptation states during motor skill training. This algorithm, that maintains the training difficulty at the ’optimal challenge point’, can be uploaded to the micro-controller to convert several shape-changing tools into adaptive tools for motor skill training. We demonstrate 7 prototypes of adaptive tools for motor-skill learning to show applications in sports, music, rehabilitation, and accessibility. },

abstract = {When beginners play the piano, the activity of the forearm muscles tends to be greater than that of experts because beginners move their fingers with more force than necessary. Reducing forearm muscle activity is important for pianists to prevent fatigue and injury. However, it is difficult for beginners to learn how to do so by themselves. We propose using electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) to teach beginners how to reduce this muscle activity while playing a tremolo: a rapid alternation between two notes. Since experts use wrist rotation efficiently when playing tremolos, we propose an EMS-based support system that applies EMS not to muscles that are relevant to moving the fingers but to the supinator and pronator teres muscles, which are involved in wrist rotation. We conducted a user study with 16 beginners to investigate how the forearm muscle activity on the extensor pollicis longus and digitorum muscles changed when using our EMS-based support system. We divided the participants into two groups: an experimental group who practiced by themselves with EMS and a control group who practiced by themselves without EMS and then practiced with instruction. When practicing by themselves, practicing with EMS was more effective than that without EMS; the activity levels of the extensor pollicis longus and digitorum muscles were significantly lower with EMS, and the participants felt less fatigue when playing tremolos. By comparing the improvement in reducing muscle activity between practicing with EMS and practicing with instruction, there was no significant difference. The results suggest that our EMS-based support system can reduce target muscle activity by applying EMS to other muscles to teach beginners how to move limbs efficiently.},
