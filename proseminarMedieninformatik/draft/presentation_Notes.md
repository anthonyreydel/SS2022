# Presentation Notes

# Introduction of the Presentation
Hello everyone, this is Chaoneng Xie. I'm a participant in the course "Proseminar Medieninformatik" in the sommer semester of 2022. In this short presentation I will introduce about my topic, and I will also talk about what I will do during this course. I hope in the end of this presentation you will get a good overview of my future work in this course. So let's begin.

## Introduction

In this course I will conduct a literature review on the topic: Technologies to support motor skill learning - musical instrument.

The learning of a traditional acoustic instrument such as piano or violin is hard. It requires strict observation of established musical discipline. The standards of a good musical performance and ways of learning and practicing have seldom changed through the years. This is especially observable in classic music education.

However, educaters and researchers are always looking for a better way of teaching and practicing. In this digital age, especially after the impact of the pandemic, the innovation of music education is going slowly but continously. This is also true in the field of study about motor learning. New devices and technologies with connections between traditional musical education and scientifical experimental methods are invented and experimented to provide music learners a better and easier learning experience

## What I will do

In this research I will try to investigate and review these new technologies. A literature search using keywords "motor skill", "motor learning", "musical instrument" and "piano" will be conducted in databases like ACM, Springer and IEEE Xplore. I will classify and compare these different technologies in regarding to supporting the learning of a musical instrument, and evaluate their effektivness. With such result I will try to predict the possible directions of this field of study in the future.


Thank you for your listening!
